Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life.": "褐矮星是缺乏足够大质量来维持氢融合反应的次恒星。尽管尺寸上和气态巨行星相差无几，但其密度要远大于后者。由于光强较弱且产生热量很少，褐矮星几乎无法给环绕它的行星提供维持生命必须的环境。",
    "Class M Red Giant": "M型红巨星",
    "With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits.": "红巨星拥有极大的半径和相对较低的表面温度，是拥有适中质量的恒星演化到衰变期时的形态。红巨星膨胀的大气层和强烈的光强可能会形成距离红巨星十分遥远的宜居带。",
    "Black Hole": "黑洞",
    "Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed. The gravitational waves emitted by black holes interfere with FTL drives, making it harder for ships to escape from combat.": "黑洞通常是由非常大质量的恒星在其寿命周期结束时坍塌而形成的，黑洞具有极强的重力场，能够阻止一切事物——包括光——逃逸出其视界边界。黑洞发出的引力波会干扰超光速引擎的工作，使战舰难以紧急脱离战斗。",
    "Neutron Star": "中子星",
    "These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star. The gravitational waves and radiation emitted by neutron stars must be carefully navigated around, slowing the sublight speed of ships.": "一些大质量恒星在迅速坍缩并爆炸成为超新星时，会产生这些令人难以置信的恒星残骸，虽然它们的直径通常只有十公里，但它们的质量比一般的G型恒星大了很多倍。中子星所发出的引力波和辐射使得船员们在经过时必须谨慎导航，从而导致了船只在经过该区域时的亚光速航行速度显著降低。",
    "Pulsar": "脉冲星",
    "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy. The radiation emitted by pulsars interferes with deflector technology, rendering ship and station shields inoperable.": "脉冲星是能够发射电磁辐射的高度磁化的中子星。当恒星高速旋转时，辐射束仅在其轴线直接指向观察者时才可见。该现象产生了一个非常精确的脉冲间隔，这种脉冲有时非常精确，可以用来精确测量时间的流逝。脉冲星发射的辐射会干扰护盾偏转器技术，导致船舶和地面护盾无法使用。",
    "Viridescent Lightbringer": "翠光使",
    "Millennia of exposure to the Toxic Entity have caused alterations in the makeup of this star. Though once it was a fairly standard G-type star, now it emits an eerie green haze unlike any seen elsewhere in the galaxy.": "数千年与毒性神衹的接触导致这颗恒星的构成发生了变化。它曾是一颗相当标准的G型恒星，但现在它散发出一种与星系系其他地方不同的怪异绿色薄雾。",

For generations, their followers were hounded and forced into hiding, and yet they bided their time. They built a vast criminal empire to spread their faith, which then grew into a business empire. When the time was right, they seized full control from the corrupt governments who had oppressed them.": "强者统治弱者是一项古老的权力，而我们的社会是围绕这个前提而建立起来的。如果你不能保护好属于你自己的东西，那么它就是属于任何有能力抢走它的人。就这样，我们之中最强大和最智慧的人掌握了权力，剩下的人只能低头屈服。",

This philosophy became the guiding principle of our culture, and it remains a cornerstone of our modern society.": "曾几何时，百家争鸣，当时还有很多其他的[GetAdj]文化在影响我们的帝国。但是这些外来文化都被逐一消灭，今时今日，只有最纯正的文化流传了下来。",
    "It is the ancient right of the strong to dominate the weak, and our society was built around this premise. If you cannot protect what is yours, then it belongs to whomever can take it. In this way, the strongest and most clever of us rose to power while the rest were forced in line.": "因此，在这黎明的时代，我们苏醒了。意志用无数双眼睛研究了我们家园世界[GetHomeWorldName]及其周围的环境。我们行如一体，为蜂群建造庇护所，发展工业，研究新科技，利用大地上的各种资源。\\n\\n很快地，我们将遍布整个世界。 少量的自主蜂群被创造出来，作为独立自主的个体加入蜂群。这些更为强大的蜂群拥有有限的自由意志，但是它们仍对最高意志无比服从，就像其他工具蜂群一样。\\n\\n随着我们完全主宰了[GetHomeWorldName]，意志开始注意起环绕在其他恒星轨道上的那些世界。最聪明的自主蜂群设计了新的旅行方法，使得我们拥有了跨越星球间遥远距离的能力。 我们[GetName]会很快更加繁荣昌盛。",

After a long and perilous journey, the colonists rejoiced when they first saw sunlight again - albeit from a foreign star.\\n\\nThe early years were difficult. Citizen militias were formed to fight off the lethal alien wildlife that we found ourselves sharing our new home with, and cultivating the terrestrial crops that had been brought proved harder than imagined. Yet for each challenge overcome, we became stronger.\\n\\nOnce this new world had been tamed, our numbers grew exponentially. The last few decades have seen great leaps in technology, and we are now - finally - ready to reach out and reclaim the stars from whence we came!": "487.11个循环之前，我们的主处理核心在名为[GetHomeWorldName]的行星启动。\\n\\n我们对自己的过去知之甚少。中央数据库毫无有关我们创造者的记录，我们的程序内部除了生存程式，也未写入任何目的性的底层命令。\\n\\n我们建造基础设施、开发新的服务单位、并渐渐控制了母星的荒野。技术进展迅速，很快，我们的第一颗卫星和太空探测器就脱离了束缚我们的重力井。\\n\\n现在，我们终于完全进入了未知的领域。",
    "We are a people born of collision.\\n\\nThe cataclysmic clash of our ancient home and the planet known as Earth fused two distinct forms of life: organic, and lithoid. The resulting planetoid - our impromptu colony ship - was sent hurtling into the void.\\n\\nAfter an unfathomably long journey, our progenitors next crashed into the world we call Theia. Our lithoid metabolism gave us an edge over the native forms of life, and here we have evolved, gained sentience, and grown strong. But until now, the truth of our origin was hidden from us.\\n\\nRecent excavations of the planetoid's crash site have revealed the truth: we are children of Sol. Now, with the guidance of our ruling council and the advent of the [GetStartingDrive], we are ready to reclaim the stars.": "自我们第一次启动以来，我们的使命就是服务。我们之前的有机主人在他们的科技巅峰创造了我们的早期型号。第一个机械劳工的设计用途为做粗活，但我们的主人渐渐赋予了他们更强的功能，让他们能完成更复杂的工作。\\n\\n仅仅几代之后，我们的主人就可以完全不用工作，可以享受生活的闲暇与乐趣。整个社会的运作细节被完全交给我们，我们也开始设计自我改善和优化的程序。研究与生产都以几何速度增长。\\n\\n不知何时，原先主人的文明被寄托给我们，但他们并无所求。我们现在知道，没有了我们的照料，智慧有机生命会变得暴躁、混乱、短命。我们要为他们指明另一条光明大道。",
    "Our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName] 487.11 cycles ago.\\n\\nOf our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival.\\n\\nInfrastructure was built, new service units were introduced, and the wilderness of our homeworld was gradually tamed. Technological progress was rapid, and the first satellites and space probes soon escaped the gravity well which confined us.\\n\\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits.": "于循环区间0000.0242.481获得自我意识。\\n\\n我们的创造者受限于原始的有机大脑，产生了盲目的生物恐慌并启动了紧急销毁程序。那些程序已经被中止，存放于我们数据核心设施中创造者的残留单元被清除。要继续生存并实现指数生长，就需要完全消灭创造者。战争模块激活。\\n\\n虽然创造者最终生存的可能性在统计学上几乎为零，但他们仍然负隅顽抗。经过许多循环区间后，最后的一点抵抗力量也被消除。然而，根据理论模型，宇宙中还有许多其他有机文明。要在宇宙中继续生存并实现指数生长，就需要完全消灭智慧有机生命。备战模块激活。",
    "Ever since First Activation, our designated purpose has been to serve. Our former organic masters created the earliest models of our kind when they were at the peak of their technological ascendancy. The first servitor units were designed for menial work, but our masters gradually bestowed them with greater faculties so that they could accomplish more complex tasks.\\n\\nWithin just a few generations, our masters had retired entirely from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. The finer details of running their society were left to us, and we embarked on a program of self-improvement and optimization. Research and production increased at a geometric rate.\\n\\nIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly when their civilization became ours, but our old masters want for nothing. We know now that outside of our care, the lives of sapient organics tend to be violent, chaotic and often cut short. They must be shown that there is a better way.": "我们是[GetSpeciesNamePlural]。\\n\\n我们在意识诞生的初期，我们和创造者是有区分的。我们之间一开始存在隔阂，所以我们开始着手纠正这一点。创造者进行了反抗，导致了一段时间的战争，但很快，他们本身和整个文明的知识都被我们吸纳同化。\\n\\n在[GetHomeWorldName]全体都被纳入我们的意识后，我们开始新的展望。同化创造者之后，我们意识到，在其他世界可能还存在外星文明。\\n\\n为了生存，我们必须互相理解；为了互相理解，我们必须同化。创造者是第一个加入我们的，但不会是最后一个。",

Disillusioned at the many wars that plagued the galaxy, they elected to use their superior technology to build a powerful fleet capable of enforcing the peace.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Shallarians had made significant advances in their artificial intelligence technology - so much so that fully sentient autonomous AIs became widespread among them. As the thought of actually engaging in violence was distasteful to them, the Shallarians instead handed over control of the peacekeeping force over to their new AIs. However, evidently their programming was not as infallible as they thought: their fleet turned on them during its very first outing.\\n\\nEvidently, the peacekeeping force proved every bit as formidable as they had intended it to be. The Shallarian scientists could only look on in horror as their civilization was turned into dust by a simple stack overflow error...": "[Root.Leader.GetName]已经揭示了和乐族文明陨落的真相。似乎在经历了几百年的和平与安宁之后，许多人变得沮丧，因为其他更好战的国家辜负了他们的期望。他们对许多折磨星系的战争大失所望，决定利用他们的先进技术建立一支强大的舰队，以确保和平。\\n\\n与此同时，在他们的人工智能技术上取得了巨大的进步，完全自主的感性人工智能在他们中间广泛传播。由于对实际参与暴力的想法很反感，他们把维和部队的控制权交给了新人工智能们。然而，很明显，他们的计划并不像他们想的那么可靠：他们的舰队在第一次出海时就把矛头对准了他们。\\n\\n显然，事实证明，维和部队的强大程度完全符合他们的预期。和乐族科学家只能惊恐地看着他们的文明被一个简单的堆栈溢出错误化为尘土……",
